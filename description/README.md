# Description

This section provides two descriptions of the raindrops protocol.

Basic will give you a high-level description with very little technical jargon to paint a picture with broad strokes for anyone to grasp. It may still require a couple re-reads. Some of these concepts are very new and repetition will help cement them in your brain.

Advanced will go into more detail on the specifics of how it works and covers several concepts that have pieces which may be difficult for a non-programmer to grasp. Don't be afraid to give it a look through if the basic description left you asking questions or you want more information.

# Staking

It is possible to Stake tokens of your choice to a Namespace, when a Namespace is initialized, token mints can be provided which are whitelisted to be eligible to be staked to the Namespace. These mints can be updated at any time over the course of a Namespaces lifecycle.

Staking is a generic term here, because we believe staking tokens can mean a lot of different things depending on the game and situation. Maybe a Namespace is a house, and to build a new floor you would need to have a player gather wood, wood in this case can be tokenized, for example a $WOOD token. Once a Player has staked enough $WOOD tokens to a Namespace, it is possible to build another floor!

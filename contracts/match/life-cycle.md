# Life Cycle

1. Draft - Nobody can join the match in this state, but it is updatable by its authority.
2. Initialized - Entrants can join provided they meet at least one TokenValidation. No TokenValidations means anybody can join. Oracles cannot effect a match in this state. Can initialize the match in this state if you wish.
3. Started - Entrants can join provided the match has join\_allowed\_during\_start is set to true. Entrants can leave if leave\_allowed is set to true. This state can only be reached by the match authority updating the match from the Initialized state.
4. Finalized - This state can only be reached by the finalized boolean on the oracle being flipped to true. Then update\_match\_from\_oracle can be called permissionlessly to get Match into this state. Once here, entrantâ€™s tokens can be paid out to the original entrants, or new recipients, based on the TokenDeltas present in the oracle. Note: An oracle need not be created for a given match until you wish to Finalize the match.
5. PaidOut - This state is reached once all tokens have been removed from the oracle.
6. Deactivated - This state can be reached via a direct call to update\_match while in Draft or Initialized state, or from PaidOut state. The Match MUST be in this state before drain\_match is available to reclaim lamports.

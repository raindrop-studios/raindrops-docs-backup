# Merklin'

While the Item contract has full support for Merklized data structures in the backend(as yet untested), Player does not. In the interests of speed and time, adding this feature was left for future development, if and only if the developer community demands it. As of this writing, we are not fully confident such a feature set is necessary for `Players` or `PlayerClasses`.

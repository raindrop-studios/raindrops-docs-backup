# Merklin'

Presently the Item contract is configured to allow for storing proof-of-data through the use of Merkle trees for ItemUsages, ItemUsageState, and Components. While all the actions and structs for using these roots and proofs are present, none of them have been tested and the CLI lacks support for these. Please avoid using this functionality and store all data on chain until this has been properly tested and debugged.

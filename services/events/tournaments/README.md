# Tournaments

_**Tournaments is set to roll out publicly throughout the next week. We are starting with the API, and then will introduce a UI so anyone can create and run tournaments without having to write any code. New features on the API will also be released on a rolling basis.**_

Tournaments is an Events service for creating and managing tournament events. Tournaments has a simple web based interface. You can use an HTTP client to interact with our API. Soon after the initial release of the API you will also be able to use a Web UI to create and run a tournament.

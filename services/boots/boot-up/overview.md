# Overview

We will take you through the following steps:

1.  &#x20;**Create Main Class**

    When you build something, you need a blueprint. We will show you here how to create your blueprint on-chain to allow your project to be booted up.
2.  **Create the Items Collection**&#x20;

    This step will establish the collection for your items. It establishes this collection of NFTs or SFTs to be able to be equipped on the NFTs of your collection.
3.  **Create the Item Classes**

    Each of the items that you want to equip on your NFTs will need to have its own blueprint. This step creates that for each of your booted items.
4.  **Create Players**&#x20;

    This last step establishes the NFTs in your collection as Bootsified NFTs.

We will assume that you have an on-chain collection of NFTs, and assume you are familiar with using a command line interface (CLI) to execute commands on your operating system of choice.

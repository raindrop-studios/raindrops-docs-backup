# Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance is explicitly **not supported** to keep things simple, _except_ in [Namespaces](https://github.com/long-banana/raindrops-docs/blob/main/concepts/broken-reference/README.md), where a single `Namespace` can be part of many other parent `Namespace`s. This is much more similar to a Mixin however, as namespaces do not inherit from a parent.
